## Introduction

Before you begin, take note that Enclosure is a __VERY__ opinionated way of writing Javascript code. It really asks you to write code in a very specific way, and yes, the code written on it looks a lot like PHP and Java (There is a reason for it).

For that reason, I don't recommend it for projects intended to run in production environments or that need to be portable with other JS libraries.

### Things that you will probably like:

- Complex and automated dependency injection
- Automated file loading and construction of classes
- No more relative paths on your Node.js code!
- Support for ES6
- Everything is in classes!

### Things that you will probably not like:

- Everything is in classes!
- It looks like somebody tried really hard to make JS look like PHP/Java (yes, there's even an entrypoint class with `main()`)
- It doesn't fit in well with other libraries (yet)
- It doesn't port to the web browser (yet)
- You have to write your project around it

### Why all this? Why not stick to JS standards?!?!

Because it's fun. Yes, it's that simple
