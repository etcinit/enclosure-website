    <div class="wrapper">
        <div class="home">

                <div class="body-col body-col-1">
                    <h3>Inspired by PHP/Java concepts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Crazy, right? Enclosure borrows a few ideas from PHP
                        and Java to organize your code around classes and keep
                        things clean.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Namespaces are generated from your projects directory
                        structure which makes your code easily accessible
                        through a custom <code>require()</code> function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hate the syntax? Enclosure is very modular so you can
                        still use DI without the module loader.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Dependency Injection</h3>
                    <p>
                        DI is performed through a service container inspired by
                        Laravel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many ways of defining dependencies
                        for your services (Constructors, Factories, Wraps)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Resolving services is super easy too, and might not even
                        require them to be explicitly defined if you use the
                        loader module.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="body-col body-col-3">
                    <h3>Weird, and fun</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's a crazy experiment, that works really well at what
                        it aims to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The module loader shifts away from how
                        <code>require()</code> regularly works in JS in order to
                        provide a way to load classes and modules using absolute
                        paths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This keeps your code clean and readable, while making it
                        painless to move files around your project's file
                        structure.

            <p>
                After setting up the container and module loader, writing applications with Enclosure ends up looking something like this (using EcmaScript 6):
            </p>

            {% highlight js %}
// With Enclosure it is possible to stop using `require` in certain
// parts of your application and just reference you classes by their
// absolute namespace
let ResponseFactory = use('MyBlog/Http/ResponseFactory'),
    Controller = use('MyBlog/Http/BaseController');

/**
 * Class IndexController
 *
 * Handles main app routes
 */
class IndexController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Construct an instance of a IndexController
     *
     * @param {LanguageService} MyBlog_Support_LanguageService
     */
    constructor (MyBlog_Support_LanguageService)
    {
        // When the container resolves the controller class, it will
        // automatically provide dependencies through the constructor.
        // Due to language restrictions, MyBlog_Support_LanguageService
        // is used as an alias for MyBlog/Support/LanguageService
        this.lang = MyBlog_Support_LanguageService;
    }

    /**
     * GET /api/v1/
     *
     * @return {Response}
     */
    getHome ()
    {
        let welcomeMessage = this.lang.get('index.welcome', 'en-us');

        return ResponseFactory.make({
            message: welcomeMessage;
        });
    }
}
            {% endhighlight %}
        </div>
    </div>
